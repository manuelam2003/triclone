Creating a Tricount clone, which is an app for managing group expenses, involves designing a database schema that can handle users, groups, expenses, and settlements. Below are the essential tables you might need:

### 1. **Users Table**

- **user_id** (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each user.
- **name**: The user's name.
- **email**: The user's email address (unique).
- **password**: Hashed password for authentication.
- **created_at**: Timestamp when the user was created.

### 2. **Groups Table**

- **group_id** (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each group.
- **group_name**: Name of the group.
- **created_by** (Foreign Key -> Users): The user who created the group.
- **created_at**: Timestamp when the group was created.

### 3. **Group Members Table**

- **group_member_id** (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each group member record.
- **group_id** (Foreign Key -> Groups): The group to which the user belongs.
- **user_id** (Foreign Key -> Users): The user who is a member of the group.
- **joined_at**: Timestamp when the user joined the group.

### 4. **Expenses Table**

- **expense_id** (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each expense.
- **group_id** (Foreign Key -> Groups): The group associated with the expense.
- **amount**: The total amount of the expense.
- **description**: Description of the expense (e.g., "Dinner").
- **paid_by** (Foreign Key -> Users): The user who paid for the expense.
- **created_at**: Timestamp when the expense was created.

### 5. **Expense Participants Table**

- **expense_id** (Foreign Key -> Expenses): The expense associated with this record.
- **user_id** (Foreign Key -> Users): The user who is participating in the expense.
- **amount_owed**: The amount that this user owes for the expense.

### 6. **Settlements Table**

- **settlement_id** (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each settlement.
- **group_id** (Foreign Key -> Groups): The group associated with the settlement.
- **payer_id** (Foreign Key -> Users): The user who is making the payment to settle debts.

### 7. **Notifications Table** (Optional)

- **notification_id** (Primary Key): Unique identifier for each notification.
- **user_id** (Foreign Key -> Users): The user receiving the notification.

### Relationships:

- **Users to Groups**: Many-to-Many via `Group Members`.
- **Groups to Expenses**: One-to-Many.
- **Expenses to Expense Participants**: One-to-Many.
- **Groups to Settlements**: One-to-Many.

### Workflow:

1. **User Sign-Up/Sign-In**: Users are created and authenticated.
2. **Group Creation**: A user creates a group and becomes the admin.
3. **Adding Members**: Users are added to the group.
4. **Adding Expenses**: An expense is created in a group, with participants and their respective shares.
5. **Settling Debts**: Users can settle debts, which are recorded in the Settlements table.

This schema covers the core functionalities of a Tricount-like application. You can extend this further with features like recurring expenses, different currencies, or detailed audit trails based on your requirements.

To build a Tricount clone, you would need a RESTful API with various endpoints to manage users, groups, expenses, and settlements. Below are the key endpoints you might want to include:

### 1. **Authentication Endpoints**

- **POST /auth/signup**: Register a new user.
- **POST /auth/login**: Authenticate a user and return a token.

### 2. **User Endpoints**

- **GET /users/{user_id}**: Retrieve user details.
- **PUT /users/{user_id}**: Update user details (e.g., name, email, password).
- **DELETE /users/{user_id}**: Delete a user account.

### 3. **Group Endpoints**

- **POST /groups**: Create a new group.
- **GET /groups**: Retrieve a list of all groups the user is a member of.
- **GET /groups/{group_id}**: Retrieve details of a specific group.
- **PUT /groups/{group_id}**: Update group details (e.g., name).

### Example API Workflow

1. **User Registration/Login**: Use `/auth/signup` and `/auth/login` for user registration and login.
2. **Group Management**: Create a group using `/groups`, and add members with `/groups/{group_id}/members`.
3. **Expense Management**: Add expenses using `/groups/{group_id}/expenses` and assign participants with `/expenses/{expense_id}/participants`.
4. **Settlements**: When debts are settled, use `/groups/{group_id}/settlements`.
5. **Balance Check**: Use `/groups/{group_id}/balance` to see who owes whom and how much.

This setup ensures a RESTful API design, covering all necessary operations for managing users, groups, expenses, and settlements, typical of a Tricount-like application.
